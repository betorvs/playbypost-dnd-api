Play by Post Dungeons and Dragons should not be a replacement for any platform for role playing games. This was designed to be a good tool to help some friends to have fun moments between sessions. 




## Postman Collection

We shared [here](https://github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd/blob/main/documentation/postman-collection/PlayByPost-DnD.postman_collection.json) a postman collection with all REST API. Just need to create a environment variable inside postman called server pointing to your local environment. For instance: `server = http://localhost:8080`.
