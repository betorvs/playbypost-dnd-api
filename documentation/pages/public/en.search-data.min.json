If you plan to do something more involved, discuss your ideas on the relevant GitHub issue.  Steps to contribute    For now, you need to add your fork as a remote on the original $GOPATH/src/github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd clone, so:\n$ go get github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd # GOPATH is $HOME/go by default. $ git remote add \u0026lt;FORK_NAME\u0026gt; \u0026lt;FORK_URL\u0026gt; Notice: go get return package github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd: no Go files in /go/src/github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd is normal.\nDependency management    We use Go modules to manage dependencies on external packages. This requires a working Go environment with version 1.15 or greater and git installed.\nTo add or update a new dependency, use the go get command:\n# Pick the latest tagged release. go get example.com/some/module/pkg # Pick a specific version. go get example.com/some/module/pkg@vX.Y.Z Tidy up the go.mod and go.sum files:\ngo mod tidy git add go.mod go.sum git commit You have to commit the changes to go.mod and go.sum before submitting the pull request.\nCoding Standards    go imports    imports should follow std libs, externals libs and local packages format\nExample\nimport ( \u0026quot;context\u0026quot; \u0026quot;net/http\u0026quot; \u0026quot;os\u0026quot; \u0026quot;os/signal\u0026quot; \u0026quot;syscall\u0026quot; \u0026quot;time\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd/config\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd/controller\u0026quot; _ \u0026quot;github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd/gateway/customlog\u0026quot; _ \u0026quot;github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd/gateway/database\u0026quot; _ \u0026quot;github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd/gateway/diceroll\u0026quot; _ \u0026quot;github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd/gateway/mongodb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/labstack/echo/v4\u0026quot; ) "},{"id":5,"href":"/development/design/","title":"Design","parent":"Development","content":"It was created using golangspell command.\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/betorvs/ mkdir playbypost-dnd cd playbypost-dnd golangspell init github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd playbypost-dnd Dependency Management    The project is using Go Modules for dependency management Module: github.com/betorvs/playbypost-dnd\nGolang Spell    The project was initialized using Golang Spell.
